#DOCUMENTATION FOR XMOD @ https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Xmodmap IS PHENOMENAL.
#Use command ``xmodmap`` to get the mapped bindings.
#xmodmap docs @web: https://linux.die.net/man/1/xmodmap
#NOTE USING xmodmap -e in different files and executing them doesn't make it to work idk why..!!
# xmodmap settings are reset by setxkbmap
set -x
#assign esc to capslock..

#I DON'T KNOW HOW BELOW SCRIPT WORKS, BUT SHIFT+CAPSLOCK IS TOGGLE CAPSLOCK AND CAPSLOCK KEY IS WORKING ADDITIONAL ESC KEY., YIKES!! 
xmodmap -e "clear lock"
xmodmap -e "clear control"

xmodmap -e "add control = Caps_Lock Control_L Control_R"
xmodmap -e "keycode 66 = Escape Caps_Lock NoSymbol NoSymbol"

# SETTING UP RIGHT ALT TO SEND SIGNAL AS LEFT ALT AS FIREFOX HAS THIS BUG I.E., RIGHT ALT DOES NOT WORK(WHILE BROWSING FACK/FORTH IN HISTORY).
xmodmap -e "clear mod5"
#xmodmap -e "clear mod1"
#xmodmap -e "keycode 92 = ISO_Level3_Shift"
#xmodmap -e "add mod5 = ISO_Level3_Shift Alt_L"
# Wow, below fix now makes my firefox binding as well as vscode bindings work like ðŸ’“ï¸Ž.
#xmodmap -e "add mod5 = Alt_L"
# ^^ this idk why stopped working in vscode, :( ::Do try it later it might work supert as it worked once.
