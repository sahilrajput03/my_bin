::TODO FOR USEWHAT::
#1 Add built in mutability for useWhat library,  an make some big projects using useWhat package. Make use of immutability for e.g.,
ic passed value to setState is object then make it new via a fresh function. Basically fresh funct fist checks for value passed is simple value like string or number or boolean then it'll call it simply the setState, if the param is object or array then {...obj} or [...arrayObj] accprdingly, if the param is function then call it with setState directly too, after making this update then useWhat will be amazing!!.. And fun... Make api like useWhati(), and this api will serve the new api that I want. Also you'll need to implement the useWhat api as well for the same shit that is immutable thing when passed for setState api. THE BIG THING HERE IS THE IMPLEMENTATION I.E., the fresh function will only be implemented if the param is equal to the previous state, if yes then apply the fresh function yikes!!..
