##NOW NAUTILUS automatically mount these drives in rw(read-only) mode, ealier it mounting in ro(i.e., read-write mode only).


sda1 => /media/array/Windows

sudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/array/Windows

sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/sda1 /media/array/Windows

##Above command gives below error:
Windows is hibernated, refused to mount.
The disk contains an unclean file system (0, 0).
Metadata kept in Windows cache, refused to mount.
Falling back to read-only mount because the NTFS partition is in an
unsafe state. Please resume and shutdown Windows fully (no hibernation
or fast restarting.)
Could not mount read-write, trying read-only
