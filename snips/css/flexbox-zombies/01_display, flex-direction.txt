*Basically makes things malleagble perpendicularly
to the flex-direction, yikes!!

align-items: stretch;(its DEFAULT)

align-items: center;
^^ this will too make it compresses to center i guess.

align-items: flex-start;
^^ this will make items align to start perpendicularly
to the flex-direction.

align-items: flex-end;
^^ ^^ this will make items align to end perpendicularly
to the flex-direction.

align-self is for individual child, yikes...
^^ all properties are same 
as of align-items.
