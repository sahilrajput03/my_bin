let m = new Promise((res, rej) => {

// ? setImmediate is equal to setTimeout with no time give or say 0 ms.
setImmediate(async () => {
  let val = await m
  console.log({val})
})

// FYI: According to MDN, no browser supports setImmediate but IEðŸ¤¾ï¸Ž.
// ? Instead of using setImmediate, you could definitely have used setTimeout as well with nothing passed as second param and it would be have in same mannerðŸ§¸ï¸Ž.
