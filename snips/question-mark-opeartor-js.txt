kyle.printName?.()
// here the code won't throw error even when the printName doesn't exist on the kyle object.
// also above code checks if printName is function if yes, then only call it, so you are saved from the runtime error of js.
// You can try document.someFun() and document.someFun?.() in browser console to test the behaviour.

let arr = [1,2]
arr?.[5] // can also be used too.
