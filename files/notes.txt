I have enabled devilspie2 on startup using above screenshot.
I added below line to ~/.profile file so that copyq is opened on user login.
flatpak run com.github.hluk.copyq &
note, i added the last & in the end of the command as it would keep the script executing otherwise the flow of execution will be stopped, and that is what you don't want..!!


#My commands in the end of .profile
devilspie2 --folder ~/my_bin/files/devilspie2 &
flatpak run com.github.hluk.copyq &
#sxhkd -c ~/my_bin/files/sxhkdrc &
#^^ this is to start key-binding software, yikes, src: https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd

To know what fonts are being used on your system just use below commands:
$ fc-match sans-serif
$ fc-match serif
$ fc-match monospace
#Yikes, src: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/412474
# They should give you the system default sans-serif, serif and monospace fonts respectively.
