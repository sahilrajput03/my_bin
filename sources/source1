#############My Comments##############

# :: Use script "add_to_fish" to add to fish shell. (Caution: It will overwrite your config.fish file, and in most cases you want that)

# :: Use script "add_to_bash" to add to bash shell. (Feel free to use this one as it won't overwrite your ~/.bashrc file at all)

# :: TO ADD THIS FILE(for fish): Run script "fishfly" in the same folder.
## LEARN: cd doesn't work subshell scripst, so remember you get to use only 
# aliases for `cding`.

# :: export PATH... command won't work for any sudo prefixed command and will rather throw
# error that binary not found, so you need to edit visudo /etc/sudoers file 
# or so, check in your "Linux walkthrough file."

# :: alias sp='cd /c/Users/chetan/AppData/Roaming/code/User/snippets/' 
# TODO: change above alias path for linux.
