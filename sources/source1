#############My Comments##############

# :: Use `secrets` file in this folder to store your secret variables. Using below "add_to_*" will source secrets files in your respective shells. Yikes!

# :: Use script "addToFish" to add to fish shell. *Tip: Use alias `fishbashrc_source` to make current shell fresh and working after sourcing the source1 and secrets scripts. Yo!

# :: (NOTE: If you are using fish shell, you don't need "addToBash" at all.) Use script "addToBash" to add to bash shell.

# :: TO ADD THIS FILE(for fish): Run script "./fishfly" in the same folder.
## LEARN: cd doesn't work subshell scripst, so remember you get to use only 
# aliases for `cding`.

# :: export PATH... command won't work for any sudo prefixed command and will rather throw
# error that binary not found, so you need to edit visudo /etc/sudoers file 
# or so, check in your "Linux walkthrough file."

# :: alias sp='cd /c/Users/chetan/AppData/Roaming/code/User/snippets/' 
# TODO: change above alias path for linux.

# :: If you wanna make aliases accessible via `sudo`(ONLY WORKS IN BASH SHELL) too, 
# then you need below alias for that:
# alias sudo='sudo '

#* Above thing doen't work for fish though, bash is better for this fix as bash recognises
# such aliases, i guess. :(
# alias sl='sudo ls -al' #FOR TESTING.

#*LEARN: For making aliases work we must do thsi..!!, so the best way to utilize 
# sudo'ed aliases is that you must use shell scripts and pass the param 
# as $* yikes!!

#* For all the shell scripts to be accessible by the sudo command as well, you need to add paths i.e., my_bin and my_bin/aliases to the `secure_path` using command `sudo visudo /etc/sudoers`.
