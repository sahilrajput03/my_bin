#workrave & 
# ^^^^ðŸ›‘ï¸Ž works well though but if it isn't installed the user login process would be affected.
#
#~/my_bin/run_workrave || echo workrave failed to open...
#workrave & || echo workrave is not installed.
#^^ðŸ›‘ï¸Ž this does not work as expected and actually block the user login script execution process.
#
flameshot &
# ^^Works pretty wel..

##ðŸ›‘ï¸ŽUsing this way also causes issue(i did try with ``flameshot &`` way, but it didn't work:: ~/my_bin/run_flameshot || echo flameshot failed to open...

# Mapping my capslock key to esc.

#Mapping my right ctrl key to capslock.

###With testing I was just trying if just reload i3 with profile script execution that might make the capslock toggling work accordingly, but isn't helping as there's no 100% knowing about how many times and for how much time after i should execute the reload of i3 but that didn't help with chaning all the parameters and it doesn't helpðŸ¥…ï¸Ž. So I am just trying to be comfortable with esc as the ever using way of vim for ever, yikes!!
#xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap
#^^ that does work like else, i.e., everything except the capslock toggling effect is there with this too.
#sleep 10 && i3-msg reload &
# ^^ that didn't work idk why, but below worked well thoughðŸ¤ºï¸ŽðŸ¤ºï¸Ž.
